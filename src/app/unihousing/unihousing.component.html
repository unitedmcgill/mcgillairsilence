					<p>Uni-Housing enclosures are an excellent choice for enclosing many types of HVAC equipment. Their modular panel construction creates a strong, self-supporting, and long-lasting enclosure that can be used for both indoor and outdoor applications. They are designed to have low leakage, provide excellent thermal and acoustical control, and facilitate easy on-site assembly. Depending upon the application and size of the enclosure, McGill AirSilence can deliver finished units or subassemblies to the job site.</p>
					<p><b>MATERIAL TYPES AND THICKNESSES</b><br />Type SL and Type TG Soundscreen acoustical panels are the basic building block of all Uni-Housing pressurized enclosures. The standard material for both the outer shell and inner liner is galvanized steel. It can be specified as either solid or perforated and has a minimum G-60 zinc coating. The perforated steel has a 23 percent open area. Many different material and gauge combinations of outer shell and inner liner can be selected, with the inner liner being either solid or perforated.<br />Both SL and TG acoustical panels are available in a standard 4-inch thickness. A 2-inch thickness is optional, with other thicknesses by special order. Standard panel widths are 24 inches and 36 inches, with standard lengths up to 12 feet. Other widths and longer lengths are also available through special order. For most enclosures, at least one special-width panel will be required as a fill-in panel to match the specified dimensions of each wall, floor, or roof assembly. Also, in most cases, maximum panel lengths will be determined by the working design pressures.</p>
					<p><b>INSULATION</b><br />The standard acoustic/thermal fill material used in Type SL and Type TG panels is 1.55 pcf fiberglass, giving the standard 4-inch panel a value of R-17.</p>
					<p><b>SURFACE BURNING CHARACTERISTICS</b><br />The Type SL and Type TG panels meet or exceed stringent fire safety requirements.</p>

					<p>Uni-Housing pressurized enclosures can be constructed from McGill AirSilence's Type SL or Type TG acoustical panel systems. The Type SL and Type TG panels are identical except for their panel joint designs. The Type SL panel has a self-locking (snap-lock) design that offers quick assembly and is used in applications where disassembly is not a primary concern. The Type TG panel has a simple tongue-and-groove design that is recommended when future disassembly and re-erection of the enclosure may be required. Both acoustical panels have a sandwich-type construction consisting of a solid galvanized steel outer shell, acoustical/thermal insulating fill, and a perforated inner liner of galvanized steel. All of the standard wall, door, roof, and floor panels are available with either the snap-lock joint design or tongue-and-groove joint design.</p>

					<p><b>ACCESS AND ACOUSTICAL DOORS</b><br />All panel systems for enclosures and barriers can be furnished with a wide variety of personnel, machinery, and material access doors. Standard access doors are 24 inches wide by 60 inches high. They are insulated and equipped with a minimum of two hinges, two door latches (with inside personnel safety releases), and gasketing. Access doors are available in both right- and left-hand swings, opening in or out.</p>
					<p><b>REMOVABLE ACCESS PANELS</b><br />When interior access is required to service or repair equipment, Uni-Housing pressurized enclosures can be fabricated with conveniently located, removable access panels. They use the same construction as the surrounding non-removable panels, but they have a larger-sized outer shell. The larger-sized outer shell allows the use of a self-sealing gasket on its inside perimeter and the use of fasteners to secure the panel in place.</p>
					<p><b>OBSERVATION WINDOWS</b><br />Access windows fro pressurized access doors are factory installed with an inner and outer pane of wire-reinforced glass, and have an air space between frames along with an air-tight window seal. Standard size is 12 inches by 12 inches. Other sizes and types are available. Obervation windows can be provided on all doors.</p>

					<p><b>FACTORY PREFORMED TRIM AND STRUCTURAL ITEMS</b><br />McGill AirSilence supplies a complete line of factory-made trim items for joining and erecting panel members and finishing out the Uni-Housing pressurized enclosure. These include standard trim items as well as optoinal special trim and structural items. All base channel and outside dtim is pre-punched during production for #10 by 3/4-inch sheet metal screws on 6-inch centers. No field drilling of these items is required. Pre-punching assures proper location of necessary fasteners. Inside trim is not prepunched in order to allow location of screws at panels joints.</p>
					<p><b>SEALER</b><br />UL-Classified United Duct Sealer is supplied in quart cartridges in sufficient quantity to assemble each Uni-Housing enclosure. It is used at the base channels, outside trim, panel joints, and with the inner trim if a pressure differential exists.</p>
					<p><b>FASTENERS</b><br />Where required, self-drilling sheet metal screws (#10 by 3/4 inch) are supplied with each Uni-Housing enclosure for assembly of trim. Sheet metal screws are not required for the Type SL panel joint except for occasional support of panels around large openings.</p>
					<p><b>PIECE MARKING</b><br />A convenient piece-marking and color-coding system for all Uni-Housing enclosure components is utilized. Each panel carries an identification mark that is keyed to the assembly drawings and indicates its location and function. A color-coding system is used to assure proper panel selection during assembly if more than one Uni-Housing enclosure is to be assembled at the job site.</p>
					<p><b>STRUCTURAL STEEL</b><br />Optional structural steel items such as pipe supports, structurals beams, angles, and channels may be required in certain Uni-Housing enclosures. In such cases, McGill AirSilence provides this information on the assembly drawings and will supply structural steel components at an additional price.</p>
					<p><b>TECHNICAL INFORMATION</b><br />In-depth information about the Uni-Housing pressurized enclosure's thermal, condensation, and acoustical performance, its special design and installation considerations, and its recommended specifications are addressed in McGill AirSilence's publication <i>Engineering Considerations and Recommended Specifications for Uni-Housing™ Enclosures</i>.</p>
